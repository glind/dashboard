## üö® CRITICAL STARTUP PROTOCOL üö®
**ALWAYS use `./startup.sh` to start the dashboard - NEVER use `python3 main.py` directly!**
- ‚úÖ Correct: `./startup.sh`
- ‚ùå Wrong: `python3 main.py`
- ‚ùå Wrong: `python -m uvicorn`
- ‚ùå Wrong: Any other method

**Why?** The startup.sh script:
- Activates the virtual environment
- Installs/updates dependencies
- Initializes the database
- Sets up proper environment variables
- Starts the server on the correct port (8008)

## Memory System
- Always check `LONG_TERM_MEMORY.md` before starting any work
- Update memory files when user preferences change
- User wants ALL data displayed with like/dislike functionality for learning preferences

## AI Assistant Memory System üß†
**BEFORE starting any work, READ THESE FILES:**
1. `.github/prompts/ai-instructions.md` - Critical rules and guidelines
2. `.github/prompts/startup-protocol.md` - Mandatory startup process  
3. `.github/prompts/user-preferences.md` - User requirements and behavior
4. `.github/prompts/project-status.md` - Current system state
5. `.github/prompts/session-memory.md` - Session history and preferences

**This ensures ALL AI assistants have consistent, up-to-date information about:**
- How to start the server correctly
- User preferences and requirements
- Current working features
- Project architecture and status
- What NOT to break
