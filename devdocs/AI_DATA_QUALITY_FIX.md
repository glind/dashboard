# AI Assistant Data Quality Fix

## Issue Identified
The AI Assistant was returning placeholder/mock data instead of real user data when answering questions about emails, calendar events, etc.

## Root Causes Found

### 1. Limited Context Access
**Problem**: The AI chat system (`/api/ai/chat`) was only using conversation history and training data, without access to real-time dashboard data.

**Solution**: Enhanced the AI chat endpoint with `build_ai_context()` function that:
- Dynamically fetches relevant data based on user queries
- Provides email data when user asks about emails
- Provides calendar data when user asks about events  
- Includes user profile information from settings
- Gives AI access to current, real data instead of just training samples

### 2. Mock Data in Database
**Problem**: The email database contained 3 fake/mock emails with placeholder data:
- `manager@buildlylabs.com` - "Urgent: Project deadline review needed ASAP"
- `colleague@example.com` - "Meeting follow-up and action items" 
- `noreply@newsletter.com` - "Newsletter: Latest updates"

**Solution**: Removed mock emails from database. Real emails from GitHub, LinkedIn, Dashlane, etc. remain.

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced AI Context System
```python
async def build_ai_context(user_message: str) -> str:
    """Build context for AI from current dashboard data based on user query."""
```

This function:
1. **Analyzes user query** for keywords (email, calendar, news, etc.)
2. **Fetches relevant data** from database tables
3. **Provides structured context** to AI with real information
4. **Handles errors gracefully** if data access fails

### Context Provided to AI
- **Email queries**: Recent emails with sender, subject, date, content preview
- **Calendar queries**: Upcoming events with time, location, description
- **News queries**: Recently liked articles and preferences  
- **Profile info**: User names, companies from vanity alert settings

## Results Achieved

### Before Fix
```
AI Response: "I've checked through your recent email history for the past 7 days. Here's a summary of what I found:
* You received an email from [Company Name] regarding a project update, with attachments.
* The email had a subject line "Project Status Update" and was sent on Wednesday at 10:00 AM."
```

### After Fix  
```
AI Response: "You have received the following recent emails:
1. From: GitHub <noreply@github.com>
2. From: Dashlane <no-reply@dashlane.com>  
3. From: Canva <marketing@engage.canva.com>
4. From: Carta Community <community@cs.carta.com>
5. From: LinkedIn <jobs-noreply@linkedin.com>"
```

## Technical Notes

### Database Cleanup
- Removed 3 mock emails, remaining 138 real emails
- Mock emails had obvious fake patterns (`@example.com`, generic subjects)
- Real emails show actual services (GitHub, LinkedIn, AWS, Google, etc.)

### AI Training vs Real-Time Data
- **Training data**: Used for learning user preferences (13 items currently)
- **Real-time context**: Used for answering specific queries about current data
- **Combination**: AI now uses both for better, personalized responses

## Prevention Measures

1. **No mock data generation** in collectors - confirmed Gmail collector is clean
2. **Context validation** - AI context function handles database errors gracefully  
3. **Real data validation** - AI will state if it can't access specific data rather than make it up

## Monitoring

To verify AI is using real data:
1. Test with email queries: `"What emails did I receive today?"`
2. Check for actual sender domains in responses
3. Monitor for placeholder patterns like `[Company Name]` or `@example.com`

The AI Assistant now provides accurate, real-time information from your actual dashboard data instead of generating placeholder responses.
